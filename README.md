# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction

Introduction
The goal of the analysis with this data is obvious. Classifying the binary dependent variable There seems to be no other goal since the data is really difficult to understand (to someone who doesn't have economic knowledge). I couldn't draw any insight as I didn't understand the bunch of variables. There was nothing I could do but model for prediction.

Goal
But we need to think about the goal of prediction. Let's suppose you want to invest in stocks. If you predicted a company would go bankrupt but it didn't, it doesn't matter because you didn't invest in the company. But in the opposite situation, it's a huge problem. Therefore, forecasting bankruptcy is more important.
