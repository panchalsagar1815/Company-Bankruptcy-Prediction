# Company-Bankruptcy-Prediction


Introduction
The "Company Bankruptcy Prediction" project is a data-driven initiative designed to enhance our ability to assess the financial stability and solvency of businesses. Leveraging critical financial metrics such as current assets, net value, growth rate, liability, equity, and more, this project aims to develop a predictive model that can identify companies at risk of bankruptcy.
